However I took the opportunity to measure the display of the NTSC-VIC on my
1084. I've resized the monitor settings so that there are no borders anymore
and I can see the full area that the VIC displays (squeezing both vertically
and horizontally). When I did the same for my PAL-VIC on the same monitor I
got exactly the 224x283 display that VICE shows in PAL for "Normal Borders"
mode, including the 284th at the bottom line that will ALWAYS be the border
color, no matter what.

Anyway, here goes for NTSC, pictures first:

Standard screen 22x23: $9000 = 5 $9001 = 25 ($19)

One character (8 pixels) to the right: $9000 = 7

Two characters (16 pixels) to the left: $9000 = 1

22 pixels up: $9001 = 14

26 pixels down: $9001 = 38

Adding another character line at the bottom: $9003 = 48 (24 lines)
Only the top rasterline of the new characterline is visible. Border-colored
single rasterline below that one

Full visible screen: 25 columns (200 pixels), 29 character lines (232 rasterlines)

Two rasterlines lower. My later experiments confirmed the last rasterline of the
last characterline is not visible here and the 234th line will always be the
border-color. So the total visible resolution is 200x233 pixels (and a 234th
rasterline in border-color)

Overview:

PAL: total screen dimension of 224x283 + 284th rasterline in bordercolor
NTSC: total screen dimension of 200x233 + 234th rasterline in bordercolor

Border margins from standard screen (after powering the device) differ from
original machine: Should be 8 pixels to the right, 16 pixels to the left, 22
pixels to the top, 26 pixels to the bottom
