This directory contains various VIA tests, ported from Andre Fachats 
"ciavarious" programs.

The idea is that Andres programs cover a bunch of things that likely matter for
the VIA too. The respective tests have been reworked to match what the original
tests want to do as close as possible. Consequently tests for cascaded timers,
and TOD clock tests, have been removed, as VIAs dont have these features.

the tests should be run on a 1541 compatible drive with drive #8. to make sure
everything works as intended, load individual tests from disk and run them.
(once run, each test will load the next one if it completed without error) do 
only have one drive connected, don't use any cartridges or kernal/drive rom 
replacements.

when run, each program will cycle through all sub tests once and then display
the results. red/green characters at bottom left indicate success/failure of
the sub tests. red/green border indicates success/failure of the complete test
(shows red if one of the sub tests failed). at the top of the screen you can
see the data recieved from the drive, in the middle the reference data, and at
the bottom both XORed so you can spot bit errors easily.

      (r32779)

VIA1:   works    Timer A / B
VIA2:   works    Timer A / B

VIA3:   works    Timer A / B IRQ Flags
VIA3a:  works    Timer A IRQ Flags

VIA4:   works    Timer A (toggle timer A timed/continous irq)
VIA5:   works    Timer A / B IRQ Flags
VIA9:   works    Timer B (toggle timer B counts PB6/Clock)

VIA10:  fail (abcdefgh)   Port B (output timer at PB7 and read back PB)
VIA11:  fail (abcdefgh)   Port B (output timer at PB7 and read back PB)
VIA12:  fail (abcdefgh)   Port B (output timer at PB7 and read back PB)
VIA13:  fail (abcdefgh)   Port B (output timer at PB7 and read back PB)
VIA14:  fail (abcdefgh)   Similar to via13, but sets the control register 
                          *before* starting the timer rather than after.

reference data comes from my 1541C and is also checked against my 1541-II, 
more testing on other drives is needed (gpz)

TODO:

- add reading and/or writing Timer A latches to all tests
- test input latching
- test serial shift register

Following is a brief overview of how certain CIA features are related to the
respective VIA features (in reality it can be assumed that CIA was actually
developed by using the VIA masks and extending them - simply because that would
save a lot of time and eventually very expensive test runs).

CIA      VIA

$dc00 -> $1801  Port A Data
n/a      $180f  Port A Data (no handshake)
$dc01 -> $1800  Port B Data
$dc02 -> $1803  Port A DDR
$dc03 -> $1802  Port B DDR

$dc04 -> $1804  Timer A lo
$dc05 -> $1805  Timer A hi
n/a      $1806  Timer A Latch lo
n/a      $1807  Timer A Latch hi
$dc06 -> $1808  Timer B lo
$dc07 -> $1809  Timer B hi

$dc08 -> n/a    TOD 10th sec
$dc09 -> n/a    TOD sec
$dc0a -> n/a    TOD min
$dc0b -> n/a    TOD hour

$dc0c -> $180a  Synchronous Serial I/O Data Buffer

$dc0d -> $180d  IRQ CTRL  (w:Enable Mask / r:Acknowledge)
         $180e  IRQ flags

$dc0e ->        CTRL A (TimerA)
$dc0f ->        CTRL B (TimerB)

         $180b  Aux Control (TimerA, TimerB)
         $180c  Peripherial Control

- no cascade mode for timers
- timers run always
  - VIA1 timer B can be stopped by configuring it to count PB6 transitions. 
    since the drive-number jumpers are wired there, it will not count.
- only first timer can be output at port B
- no TOD clock
+ seperate register for the Timer A latch
