Notes about the tests from the PC64-Testsuite
---------------------------------------------

These tests check all 6502-opcodes and were mass converted using TMPView[1] and
a shell script utilizing sed and awk. With 2.5 KB of script code, I managed to
batch "port" all but two tests from the c64 to the 1541! (I am still amazed
myself). The necessary files for that conversion are stored in the
'extra' directory.

The converted code is still not pretty, but it seems to work nicely and already
spotted some bugs in the 1541 Ultimate. An error code of $FF means that the
resulting flags or registers are not the way they were expected by the test.
$FE usually means the stack was not as expected. You have to dive into the
source code to get a better picture, batch documenting was too much ;)

Most problematic were opcodes which change the PC. This is why JMP ($xxxx) and
BRK could not be mass converted. And the other opcodes (JMP, JSR, branches)
will most likely crash if they don't behave as expected. So, you won't get an
error, but a timeout. If you know a better method for these tests, I am happy
to learn about it! Same goes for any other comment.
