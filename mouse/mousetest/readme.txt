This directory contains a combined mouse test program written by Marco Baye.

Right now you can use it to test the following kinds of mice (and find out which
one you have there...)

- 1351 (and compatible, such as Micromys and CMD Smartmouse)
- Atari cx22 Trackball
- Atari ST mouse
- Amiga mouse


TODO:
-----

support NEOS mouse
support paddles
support koala pad?
find out how CMD smartmouse encodes middle button (same as MicroMys?)

disable CIA IRQ?
disable ROMs, use hardware irq/nmi vectors instead?

use y-expanded sprites and make them look like mice?

make RESTORE also reset 1351 interval?
