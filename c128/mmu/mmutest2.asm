; If the stack is in in shared memory
; it doesn't care if register $d50a (P1H) points to bank 0 or bank 1
;
; Test if the stack is in bank 0 and bank 1 when
; the stack is moved in shared memory, but 
; the bank for the stack was switched by register $d50a (P1H)
;
; This test is the extension to mmutest.a
; The values of the register $d50a are changed.
