NOTE: this is still initial WIP


TODO:
    - prepare dtv/x128/xpet/plus4/cbm2 for tests that use screenshots

    write proper docs :)
    write proper TODO list :)

    fix VICE bugs:
        - crash when using -exitscreenshot with -console
        xcbm2:
            -VICIIfilter doesnt work?
            -VICIIextpal
            -VICIIpalette

KLUDGES:
    - when crt or d64 is mounted and no .prg is given, only the path (and not
      the actual failed test) will go into the results file
    - we need to implement some way to choose between VDC/VICII
     - currently x128 screenshots are always from VDC
     - currently x128c64 screenshots are always from VICII

prerequisites
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a little bit of setup is needed to use the testbench:

* a C compiler must be available (to build some support tools)
* the "acme" crossassembler must be installed (to (re)build the selftests)
* copy "Makefile.config.example" to "Makefile.config" and edit it to your needs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
================================================================================
preparing tests
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"debug cartridge" register locations:

C64     $d7ff
C128    $d7ff
VSID    $d7ff
SCPU    $d7ff
DTV     $d7ff
VIC20   $910f  (discussion: http://sleepingelephant.com/ipw-web/bulletin/bb/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=7763 )
PLUS4   $fdcf  (discussion: http://plus4world.powweb.com/forum.php?postid=31417#31429)
PET     $8bff
CBM510  $fdaff
CBM610  $fdaff

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the test program writes its exit code to the "debug cartridge" register,

$00 - for success
$ff - for failure

the respective memory locations have been choosen so they will most likely never
collide with any kind of extension.

when a value was written to the debug register, the emulator should exit with
the value written as exit code. see further down for hints on how to implement
similar behaviour on real hardware.

a typical test program will print its name on screen, and end with green or red
border, followed by the respective write to the debug register.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tests that have to be checked by screenshot must contain reference screenshots
that are named the same as the tests with an additional .png extension, in a
subdirectory called "references". like this:

./mytest.prg
./references/mytest.prg.png

the reference screenshots should be taken with default screen dimensions,
with CRT emulation disabled.

- for C64: use the "pepto" palette (pepto-pal.vpl)
- for VIC20: use the "mike" palette (mike-pal.vpl)

typically tests that will be checked by screenshot should wait a frame before
writing their exit code to the debug register.

TODO: add support for palettes in the testlist somehow
TODO: get rid of the border mode dependency

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
================================================================================
adding new tests
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

when adding new tests to the test repository, you should also put them into one
(or more) of the following files:

c64-testlist.in
c128-testlist.in
cbm510-testlist.in
cbm610-testlist.in
dtv-testlist.in
pet-testlist.in
plus4-testlist.in
vic20-testlist.in
scpu-testlist.in
vsid-testlist.in

after updating any of these files, regenerate the test lists:

$ make testlist


format of the abc-testlist.in files:
------------------------------------

<path to test>,<test executable name>,<test type>,<timeout>,<options>

test type:
    exitcode
    screenshot
    interactive
    analyzer

options:
    - extra options, which are translated to actual commandline options by the
      respective driver script

TODO: when you add support for certain features that require options as above,
      don't forget to add them here :)

================================================================================
running the tests
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

first of all copy Makefile.config.example to Makefile.config and edit it to your
needs (see instructions inside this file).

the Makefile in this directory serves as the main frontend to the testbench. to
get a list of things you can do just run "make".

you can also run ./testbench.sh manually:

usage: ./testbench.sh [target] <filter> <options>
  targets: x64, x64sc, x128c64, x128, xscpu64, x64dtv, xpet, xcbm2, xcbm5x0, xvic, xplus4, vsid, 
           chameleon, cham20, c64rmk2, hoxs64, micro64, emu64, yace
  <filter> is a substring of the path of tests to restrict to
  --help       show this help
  --verbose    be more verbose
  --pal        skip tests that do not work on PAL
  --ntsc       skip tests that do not work on NTSC
  --ntscold    skip tests that do not work on NTSC(old)
  --ciaold     run tests on 'old' CIA, skip tests that do not work on 'new' CIA
  --cianew     run tests on 'new' CIA, skip tests that do not work on 'old' CIA
  --6581       run tests on 6581 (old SID), skip tests that do not work on 8580 (new SID)
  --8580       run tests on 8580 (new SID), skip tests that do not work on 6581 (old SID)
  --8562       target VICII type is 8562 (grey dot)
  --8562early  target VICII type is 8562 (new color instead of grey dot)
  --8562late   target VICII type is 8562 (old color instead of grey dot)
  --8565       target VICII type is 8565 (grey dot)
  --8565early  target VICII type is 8565 (new color instead of grey dot)
  --8565late   target VICII type is 8565 (old color instead of grey dot)
  --8k         skip tests that do not work with 8k RAM expansion

by default, the testbench script expects the VICE binaries in a directory
called "trunk" which resides in the same directory as the "testprogs"
directory. if that is not the case you can give the VICE directory on the
commandline like this:

$ EMUDIR=/c/users/youruser/somedir/WinVICE-2.4.99 ./testbench x64

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
================================================================================
running tests on another supported target/emulator
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

so far, all emulators of VICE are supported:

x64
x64sc
x128c64     - x128 in C64 mode
x128
xscpu64
x64dtv
xpet
xcbm2
xcbm5x0
xvic
xplus4
vsid

additionally some other emulators have implemented a suitable set of options:

hoxs64      - hoxs64, c64
micro64     - micro64, c64
emu64       - (WIP) emu64, c64 (http://www.emu64.de)
yace        - (WIP) yace, c64 (http://www.yace64.com)
z64kc64     - (WIP) z64k, c64 (http://www.z64k.com/)
z64kc128    - (WIP) z64k, c128
z64kvic20   - (WIP) z64k, vic20

also some "real" hardware is supported:

chameleon   - turbo chameleon C64 core via USB link
cham20      - chameleon vic20 core via USB link
c64rmk2     - C64R-MK2 via USB link

TODO: add support for more emulators and "real" hardware. if you are a emulator-
      or hardware maker - please get in touch with us!


make sure to give the full path to the emulator binary, and use the respective 
switches to skip tests that make no sense and/or can not work.

$ EMUDIR="/c/hoxs64_x64_1_0_9_3_sr1" ./testbench.sh hoxs64 --pal --8565early --8580

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
================================================================================
adding support for another target/emulator
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

additional targets/emulators can be hooked up fairly easy, only a few simple
features are needed. 

*** in case of VICE they are called like this, for actual emulators you will want
    to implement something along these lines:

-debugcart
  enable a virtual "debug cartridge" which consists of one write-only register.
  when a value is written to that register, the emulator should exit with the
  written value as exitcode. see "preparing tests" above for the location of the
  debug registers for the different machines.

-limitcycles <n>
  after the emulation has run N cycles, exit the emulator with exitcode 1 - this
  will enable the testbench to continue even when a test hangs/crashes.

-exitscreenshot <name>
  at exit, save a screenshot. this is required for the tests that can not work
  with an exitcode, ie the result can only be determined by looking at the output

-exitscreenshotvicii <name>
  same as above, for vicii screen on c128

additionally, there must be a way to automatically run a program from commandline,
and to mount disk- and cartridge images. it also helps to have a "warp" mode, and
to be able to disable the GUI/graphics screen (but this is not strictly necessary)

for further hints see testbench.sh and x64-hooks.sh

*** for real hardware, some things might have to be handled differently:

- the debug register should be implemented as a register or ram location in the
  I/O space. the value written to it must be readable from the remote host, and
  there must be a way to change/reset the value from the host. (the script will
  initialize this value with something like 42 and then poll it in intervals
  until it changes)
  
- there must be a way to reset the target via the remote interface

- there must be a way to read and write the c64 memory via the remote interface

- for the screenshot based tests to work, some way to make screenshots via the
  remote interface must be provided.
  
- a way to change disk images, cartridge images, ROM contents etc must be
  provided to run tests related to these.

- for FPGA based platforms, it generally makes sense to expose all RAM to the
  remote interface, including frame buffers, image storage, ROMs etc. the remote
  host can then run a tool that does all the fancy things via a relatively 
  simple interface to the target.
  
for further hints see testbench.sh and chameleon-hooks.sh
