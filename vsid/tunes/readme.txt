this directory contains tunes from the HVSC which rely on certain border cases,
and/or can be used to check certain features/properties of the psid player.

note that often tunes are fixed/updated so they can be played on a real C64
without hassle, meaning some of the problems below may not show anymore in a
recent copy of HVSC.

"Some other fixes is about sids overwriting $fffa-ffff. Usually it's just
 garbage to be removed, sometimes it needs to be relocated if the bytes
 at $fffa-ffff are actually used and there is no actual bankswitching."

"default tune is out of range (incorrectly set to 0 instead of 1)"
GAMES/M-R/Masters_of_Time.sid

"Tunes that write outside their range can overwrite the sid player code if the 
freepages aren't set.
 This is one example, SoundMonitor tune that writes to $07xx but with no 
 freepages set the sid player is free to use memory from $0400 onward, and 
 there will be problems sooner or later."

NOTE:

- compute gazette sidplayer files that are embedded into the PSID format without
  being merged with a player binary are not common "in the wild" and thus no 
  real examples have been added. look in the "sidplayer" subdirectory for some
  artificial tests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:

- make sure all kinds if setups, speeds, flags etc combinations are covered by
  the test tunes
