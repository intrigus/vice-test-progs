"The follwing code worked fine for most emulated real drives that I've tried, 
but with the fs drive, there has been some unrealiablility inf. loop also in 
the code below), so I had to comment out some lines to match c64 ROM. This 
might not be a bug (my guess is my code was beond the 80Âµs minimum spec.), 
but probably a noteworthy difference, given the purpose of the fs drv."

The program tries to load a file named "testseq,s,r" mutiple times, first with
the corrected version of the snippet, then with the problematic lines 
uncommented.

On success, the program shows green border. If the testfile isn't found, 
it shows red border.
