This directory contains some tests related to the serial shift register of the
CIA6526(A).


cia-sp-test-oneshot-new.prg
cia-sp-test-oneshot-old.prg
---------------------------

serial shiftregister irq checks derived from the protection of arkanoid
(http://csdb.dk/release/?id=40451)

border color shows the test result:

red: no irq occured at all
yellow: number of occured interrupts is wrong
green: passed

NOTE: this test fails on hoxs64 v1.0.8.7, micro64 1.00.2013.05.11 - build 714,
      x64sc 2.4.15 r29241

cia-sdr-load.prg
----------------

from https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/bugs/1219/

It seems the new byte is only taken into the shift register on the first timer 
underflow. So one has to introduce the delay to make sure one timer underflow 
appears before writing a new byte.

The CIA datasheet however says: "The data in the Serial Data Register will be 
loaded into the shift register, then shift out to the SP pin when a CNT pulse 
occurs."

So it should be possible (and in my previous (historic) experience I think it 
is) that when the SDR is empty one can directly write two bytes without delays: 
one that is immediately passed through to the actual shift register, while the 
second byte stops in the SDR, to be loaded into the shift register when it ran 
empty. (I probably should confirm this next week, but the code without the delay 
ran successfully in older days on real hardware)

The test program shows different timing between the x64sc and a C128 in C64 
mode or a C64. VICE prints out 10 times "$FCF2" while the C64 prints out "$FCEB" 
(with only 1-2 cycles off in the first iterations each).

However, that does not show the actual problem when shifting out the data. The 
test writes to SDR twice directly after each other. In the real machine, the 
RS232 transmits all 16 bits - in VICE SDR, the rs232 code only gets a single 
byte - so output is mangled. But that is not something an all-in-the-machine 
test can show.


cia-sdr-init.prg
----------------

from https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/bugs/1219/

"This simply tests when the shift register acknowledges it is empty with 1 byte 
writen to the SDR register. 

This passes on my real c64c and c128D in c64 mode. It fails in VICE. VICE result 
is FCF1, real result is FCEA."


cia-sdr-delay.prg
----------------

from https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/bugs/1219/

"Another test which adds a delay before writing a byte to the SDR after Timer A 
has started and waits until the SDR flag is set. The test executes 21 times 
decreasing the delay by 1 cycle each run. Red text in results shows mismatch in 
timing compared to my real hardware(same systems as decribed above) .

Pattern on real hardware:  FCE6, FCE7, FCE8, FCE9, FCEA, FCE4, FCE5
Pattern on VICE:           FCED, FCEE, FCE8, FCE9, FCEA, FCEB, FCEC

Based on these results it looks like there is a 4 cycle delay on real hardware 
compared to VICE for when the SDR flag is set. More tests should probably be 
done with different baud rates to see if the delay is consistent."
