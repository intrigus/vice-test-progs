taken from https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests

the 3 tests have been ported to the Commodore C64, and can now be assembled
using the ACME assembler.

TODO:
- 65C02 testsuite obviously doesnt make sense running on the C64 and should
  be changed to run on a PET/CBM2/whatever

- 6502 interrupt tests require writeable IRQ vector (FFFE/FFFF) and extra
  hardware (feedback register connected to IRQ lines), so they can not work
  on C64 etc, the have been removed from here.

original readme:

This is a set of functional tests for the 6502/65C02 type processors.

The 6502_functionel_test.a65 is an assembler sourcecode to test all valid
opcodes and addressing modes of the original NMOS 6502 cpu.

The 65C02_extended_opcodes_test.a65c tests all additional opcodes of the
65C02 processor including undefined opcodes.

The 6502_interrupt_test.a65 is a simple test to check the interrupt system
of both processors. A feedback register is required to inject IRQ and NMI
requests.

Detailed information about how to configure, assemble and run the tests is
included in each source file.

The tests have primarily been written to test my own ATMega16 6502 emulator
project. You can find it here: http://2m5.de/6502_Emu/index.htm

A discussion about the tests can be found here:

Good luck debugging your emulator, simulator, fpga core, discrete
logic implementation or whatever you have!
