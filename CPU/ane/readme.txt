this directory contains tests to verify and examine how the RDY line (DMA)
affects the ANE #imm opcode.

in general it appears the timing of the side effects are stable, but the values
are not.

ANE #imm
--------

A = ((A | CONST) & X & IMM)
 
with N = X & IMM we get: A = (A | ?) & N

A       N           !A   N    
0 | ? & 0 = 0        1 & 0 = 0
1 | ? & 0 = 0        0 & 0 = 0
0 | ? & 1 = ?        1 & 1 = 1
1 | ? & 1 = 1        0 & 1 = 0

so when a bit in A is 0 and in N is 1, the result is unknown/unstable

((A ^ 0xff) & N) returns the affected unstable bits, ie operation is unstable 
if ((A ^ 0xff) & N) != 0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ane.prg:

test ane #imm for side effects connected with the RDY line. 

for some combinations of A and IMM bit0 and/or bit4 (?) will drop off (turn 0?) 
when the RDY line changes state at the beginning of badline DMA (?)

interesting values will appear in the pattern where marked with dark(er) grey

ane-border.prg:

runs the same test in border with sprites, demonstrates the side effects are
there also.

interesting values will appear in the pattern where marked with dark(er) grey

ane-none.prg:

runs the same test in border with no sprites to show there are no more side 
effects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ane.prg and ane-border.prg are verified on my c64c (gpz) 

note that the magic constant is being checked against the desirable properties 
outlined below in the code analysis from real world programs. 

THIS MEANS THE TEST WILL ALSO FAIL ON SOME REAL C64s.

the value after RES: in the bottom line should always be green (it will be green
when all stable bits match what we expect them to be)

if the value after CON: is red, then the magic constant does not match the
desirable properties - and the test will fail. this does not actually mean that
ANE does not work as expected, but it means that it behaves in a way that will
make some or all of the analysed real world programs not work correctly.

For Emulation the best compromise between "proper emulation" and "making things
work" seems to be to use a "magic contant" of $EF in regular cycles, and $EE in
the RDY cycle.

02b0 ANE #$51 ; A=$00 X=$ff -> A=$51 (unstable)
02b6 ANE #$e1 ; A=$51 X=$ff -> A=$e1 (unstable)

this code works correctly with ANE magic constant "$FF" but not with "$EE"

for the game to load, the high nybble of the constant must be $4,$5,$e or $f and
bit 0 must be 1, bits 3,2,1 are "don't care". -> constant $ef will work

6387  8D 2A 63    STA $632A ; result is 0..3, all bits instable

if the intention was to do A = A & X & 3, then bit 0 and bit 1 being 0 in the 
magic constant is needed for it to work correctly
(more likely) if the intention was basically just A = X & 3 (and save a txa) 
then bit 0 and bit 1 in the magic constant must be 1 for it to work correctly.

ta_scrolling_1&2:line 1650

a bunch of sequences like this:

lax ($10),y     ; load A and X
and #$0f
ora #$b0        ; 10110000 bit7,5,4 are 1 in A
sta $11
xaa #$f0        ; A = (A | ?) & X & $f0     bit 6 is unstable
ora ystep
sta $10
lax ($12),y

assuming the intention was to do A = X & $f0, bit 6 must be 1 in the magic 
constant

-> we want a magic constant with at least these 1s: 01000011 ($ef will work)
