<gpz> (remove this file when refactoring is done, update readme accordingly)

i am in the process of refactoring all the included programs, so common code
will be included from the files in src/common, which will make the whole test-
suite portable and easier to maintain.

look at template.s, finish.s, start.s for examples

at top:

copy header, adjust current/next testname
remove basicline and printing of name
add "main" 

at bottom:

remove from "print ok" to "jmp $e16f" by 
        rts ; SUCCESS

                    jsr print
                    .text " - ok"
                    .byte 13,0

                    lda #0         ; success
                    sta $d7ff

            load     jsr print
            name     .text "adcix"
            namelen  = *-name
                    .byte 0
                    lda #0
                    sta $0a
                    sta $b9
                    lda #namelen
                    sta $b7
                    lda #<name
                    sta $bb
                    lda #>name
                    sta $bc
                    pla
                    pla
                    jmp $e16f


replace $d7ff stores by
        #SET_EXIT_CODE_FAILURE

remove showregs
remove print

CAUTION: there is a .bend in the middle of the showregs function in some files,
the opening .block is above at the beginning of "check"
