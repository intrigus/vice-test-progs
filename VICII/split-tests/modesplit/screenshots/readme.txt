the makefile can be used to create "animations" from the reference picture and
the screenshots.

two kind of animations will be produced

- .gif format (which all viewers can show, however they are 256 colors only and
  that may be problematic and not allow to see all details)
- .apng format (which is truecolor, but few viewers support it - firefox for
  example will show the animation, many other viewers will only show the first
  frame)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

modesplit:

- zerox-6569r1 shows differences
- zerox-6569r5_1886_s shows differences
- zerox-8565r2 shows differences


TODO: 

- we need more, and more detailed screenshots so the references can be fixed
  and verified
- additional reference (and testsuite support) for 6569r1 might be needed
