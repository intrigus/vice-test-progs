40 columns mode test for VDC.

Note,this program produces a slightly unstable picture on my capture card,
so sync values might not be perfect, but shouldn't affect emulation.


What's it to?

Changes VDC registers as follows:

$19 = $57 Enable double pixel mode by setting bit 4 (other bits default)
Quote from "Mapping the commodore 128" p450-451:
Bit 4: This bit controls the VDC's pixel double feature. While
this bit is %0, pixels will be their normal size. Setting this bit
to %1 will double the size of all horizontal screen pixels. Since
each pixel is twice as large, there will be room for only half as
many on the screen. Thus, you must reduce the values in the
horizontal screen width registers (0-2/$00-$02) to half their
normal values.

Halve the registers mentioned above:
$00 = $3f Halve total number of horizontal character positions
(full raster width including borders/sync) from 126 (default) to 63
$01 = $28 Halve active horizontal character positions (active screen size) from 80 (default) to 40
$02 = $35 Halve (roughly) horizontal sync position from 102 to 53

Misc:
$03 = $49 (Don't know exactly, this is the default value for sync width)
$16 = $89 Increase character width from 8 to 9 (why??)
$1b = $28 Address increment per row to 40 (from 80) to match screen width

Then set zero page $e7 to $27 (39) so basic thinks you have 40 columns.

End
