this little program can be used to verify that a cartridge is properly disabled
when RUNning a program. the expected/correct output very much depends on the
individual cartridge and cartridge-ROM (see below).

- in the first two rows you see a dump of the values read from the beginning
  of the IO1 and IO2 blocks
- below that is a copy of what can be read from $8000. if you see a pattern that
  shows all values 0...$ff then you are looking at the C64 RAM
- next is the IO1 page
- last not least the IO2 page

- after RESET restart the program with SYS 2560
